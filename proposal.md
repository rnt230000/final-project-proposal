## Description
After executing the program, a window should pop up and the program should fill the black screen with 4 surfaces with different colors one by one (red, blue, green, & gray) with 4 images (PNG images are already made by me) that’ll fade in afterwards. Then an image of the title and buttons will fade in; however, the start button will fade in and out.

## Features
- Feature 1: pygame.draw.rect()
	- Will open a window to use to create my starting screen.
- Feature 2: pygame.Surface()
	- To create 4 surfaces.
- Feature 3: .blit()
	- To add image.
- Feature 4: sleep() from unistd.h library.
	- To delay an execution for a specified number of seconds.

## Challenges
- Glow effect. Need to research on whether or not glow effect is possible for the colors. 
- Research on how to display parts of an image onto the surfaces.
- Execution delay. Need to esearch on how to delay or pause an execution for 1 second.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- My idea for this project is to create a creative transition for a title screen for a made-up game using GIFs and images. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The good outcome would be to demonstrate the usefulness of applying images onto surfaces and timing.

## Milestones

- Week 1 (11/11 - 11/15)
  1. Goal 1
     - Make a window and fill the screen black.
  2. Goal 2
     - Create four surfaces with each of them in different colors (Red, Blue, Green, and Gray).
  3. Goal 3
     - Make sure all 4 surfaces spawn in the correct coordinates.

- Week 2 (11/16 - 11/22)
  1. Goal 1
     - Make the red and gray surface travel upwards, and the green and blue surface travel downward.
  2. Goal 2
     - Work on delaying the execution of each surface by 1 or 2 seconds.

- Week 3 (11/23 - 11/29)
  1. Goal 1
     - Work on making the colors glow and add a loop to it.
  2. Goal 2
     - Add png images into the program.

- Week 4 (Final) (11/30 - 12/8)
  1. Goal 1
     - Add an image that shows a start button and loop it, fading in and out.
  2. Goal 2
     - Polish the project if finished.
